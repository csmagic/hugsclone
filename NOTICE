--         CONDITIONS OF USE, DUPLICATION AND DISTRIBUTION (*)		     --

--  Permission to use, copy, modify, and distribute Hugs for any personal    --
--  or educational use without fee is hereby granted, provided that:	     --
--									     --
--   a) This copyright notice is retained in both source code and	     --
--      supporting documentation.					     --
--									     --
--   b) Modified versions of this software are redistributed only if	     --
--      accompanied by a complete history (date, author, description) of     --
--      modifications made; the intention here is to give appropriate	     --
--      credit to those involved, while simultaneously ensuring that any     --
--      recipient can determine the origin of the software.		     --
--									     --
--   c) The same conditions are also applied to any software system	     --
--      derived either in full or in part from Hugs.			     --
--									     --
--  No part of Hugs may be distributed as a part or accompaniment of any     --
--  commercial package or product without the explicit written permission    --
--  of the author and copyright holder.  The distribution of commercial	     --
--  products which require or make use of Hugs will normally be permitted    --
--  if the Hugs distribution is supplied separately to and offered at cost   --
--  price to the purchaser of the commercial product.			     --
--									     --
--  In specifying these conditions, our intention is to permit widespread    --
--  use of Hugs while, at the same time, protecting the interests, rights    --
--  and efforts of all those involved.  Please contact the author and	     --
--  copyright holder to arrange alternative terms and conditions if your     --
--  intended use of Hugs is not permitted by the terms and conditions in     --
--  this notice.							     --
--									     --
--  While Hugs has much in common with Gofer (from which it was originally   --
--  derived), there are also some significant differences between the two    --
--  systems.  For example, Hugs conforms closely to the Haskell standard     --
--  while Gofer was intended as a more experimental system.  As a result,    --
--  any and all rights previously conferred for the use, duplication, and    --
--  distribution of Gofer do NOT automatically carry over to Hugs.           --
--									     --
--  NOTICE: Hugs is provided "as is" without express or implied warranty.    --
--									     --
--  (*) For the purposes of this document, the word "Hugs" refers both to    --
--      the software and its accompanying documentation.		     --
