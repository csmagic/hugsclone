This is the Readme file for Hugs 1.3, the Haskell User's Gofer System.

Hugs 1.3 is an interpreter that provides an almost complete implementation
of Haskell 1.3; the only feature that is not supported is the module system.

Already, there are ambitious plans for the future, with collaboration and
joint releases from the functional programming groups at Nottingham and
Yale.  For example, in the near future, we expect to release a system
combining the best of Hugs 1.3 and the recent Yale release of Hugs 1.01.
This will provide full support for Haskell 1.3, modules, and libraries for
both X window and Win32 programming.  However, we also intend to maintain
the current release as a relatively small and stable system that will be
suitable for teaching and research, even on fairly small machines.

Your feedback, comments, suggestions and bug reports are most welcome!
