The following procedure is suggested for installation of Hugs on a Unix
machine.  (Precompiled binaries are provided for common PC platforms,
although similar installation procedures can be used for these machines
if you have a suitable C compiler.)

 0) Compile the interpreter by editing src/Makefile, by selecting the
    desired operating system/compiler configuration in src/prelude.h
    and by running make.  Not all of the combinations listed in the
    prelude.h file have been tested recently, so please report any
    problems and updates to me.

 1) Choose a directory for the Hugs files to go in, say /usr/local/Hugs
    and copy the lib and libhugs directories, together with the executable
    from step (1), into this directory.  Ensure that these files have
    appropriate permission settings.  If you like, you can copy the
    demos to this subdirectory also.

 2) Edit the script file `Hugs' to point to the directory chosen in
    step (1) and to set any preferred command line arguments.  Copy
    this script file into a suitable directory; your own bin directory,
    for example, or a system wide directory like /usr/local/bin.
